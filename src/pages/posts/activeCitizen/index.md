I created a company in 54h. What did you do last weekend? Reads on the t-shirt of Startup weekend. In conjunction with other great techies and entrepreneurial-minded people we participated in creating Active Citizen, an initiative in charge of simplifying policy for everyone. In the course of a weekend we crafted a business plan, executed a prototype and launch the project for final pitch on Sunday. The experience was one of kind and weâ€™ll totally do it again. In the meantime we hope Active Citizen can develop and become a resource for all of us interested in knowing and following the the political scene a little closer. Take a look at the prototype [here](http://activecitizens.co "Active Citizen Prototype").
